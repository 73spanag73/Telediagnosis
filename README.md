# Telediagnosis for COVID 19

SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL

Aim: 

The reduction of unnecessary visits to health care facilities and of physical direct exposure of doctors and patients, in an effort to reduce COVID 19 transmission, by supporting clinical examination and patient monitoring through a dedicated telediagnosis platform allowing complete tele-examination and reliable tele-monitoring. 

Proposal: 

The development of an electronic health record with clinical decision support features, which will allow secure video conference (teleconsultation) supported by real time vital signs tele-monitoring (transcutaneous saturation, blood pressure, pulses) and tele-examination (digital stethoscope-remote auscultation). Availability of telemedical kits (mobile devices with appropriate peripherals for tele-examination/monitoring), which will be available to mild-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients followed in home or in hospital wards. Sustainability of the proposal, which can be adapted according to specific needs, as a secure platform for telemedicine purposes based on national priorities and needs.
